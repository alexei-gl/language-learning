twice told tales

snow-flakes

by nathaniel hawthorne

it is to be , in good earnest , a wintry storm .

the cloud-spirits are slowly weaving her white mantle .

thus gradually , by silent and stealthy influences , are great changes wrought .

we , likewise , shall lose sight of our mother's familiar visage , and must content ourselves with looking heavenward the oftener .

now , leaving the storm to do his appointed office , let us sit down , pen in hand , by our fireside .

in our brief summer , i do not think , but only exist in the vague enjoyment of a dream .

however transitory their glow , they at least shine amid the darksome shadow which the clouds of the outward sky fling through the room .

now look we forth again , and see how much of his task the storm-spirit has done .

slow and sure !

he has the day , perchance the week , before him , and may take his own time to accomplish nature's burial in snow .

very sad are the flower shrubs in midwinter !

the roofs of the houses are now all white , save where the eddying wind has kept them bare at the bleak corners .

look next into the street , where we have seen an amusing parallel to the combat of those fancied demons in the upper regions .

it is a snow-battle of school-boys .

what pitched battles , worthy to be chanted in homeric strains !

what storming of fortresses , built all of massive snowblocks !

what feats of individual prowess , and embodied onsets of martial enthusiasm !

who reared it ?

and what means it ? "

the shattered pedestal of many a battle monument has provoked these questions , when none could answer .

would it might inspire me to sketch out the personification of a new england winter !

how does winter herald his approach ?

it is stern winter's vesture .

it is the voice of winter ; and when parents and children bear it , they shudder and exclaim , " winter is come !

cold winter has begun his reign already ! "

there he lies stark and stiff , a human shape of ice , on the spot where winter overtook him .

on strides the tyrant over the rushing rivers and broad lakes , which turn to rock beneath his footsteps .

his dreary empire is established ; all around stretches the desolation of the pole .

such fantasies , intermixed among graver toils of mind , have made the winter's day pass pleasantly .

on the window-sill , there is a layer of snow , reaching half-way up the lowest pane of glass .

the garden is one unbroken bed .

next comes a sledge , laden with wood for some unthrifty housekeeper , whom winter has surprised at a cold hearth .

but what dismal equipage now struggles along the uneven street ?

a sable hearse , bestrewn with snow , is bearing a dead man through the storm to his frozen bed .

o , how dreary is a burial in winter , when the bosom of mother earth has no warmth for her poor child !

alas !

i shiver , and think it time to be disconsolate .

whence come they ?

where do they build their nests , and seek their food ?

i know not whence they come , nor why ; yet my spirit has been cheered by that wandering flock of snow-birds .
